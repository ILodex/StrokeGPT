v1.2 - Fixed AI Depth Understanding: Made it so "tip," "mid," and "deep" strokes actually mean the right thing no matter your Max Depth setting.
Fixed AI Speed Perception: Told the AI exactly what "slow," "medium," and "fast" speeds are in numbers so it controls the Handy better.
Removed Unnecessary Speed Cap: Changed how the Handy moves so it can go faster even at shallow depths, for more fun teasing.
Introduced Max Depth Limiter:
    Added a "Max Depth" slider on the screen for you to set how far the Handy goes.
    Built in some code to remember your Max Depth setting even when you close the app.
    Most importantly, put a hard limit in the Handy control code to make sure it NEVER goes past your Max Depth, no matter what the AI tries to do.
Resolved UI Interactivity Issues: Fixed some messed-up code in index.html so all the buttons and sliders work right.
Fixed Preference Saving Errors: Fixed problems that stopped your settings from saving when you closed the app.
v1.2 - The Ergonomics & Audio Update

- New Feature: ElevenLabs Integration: Added full voice support using ElevenLabs, with settings for your API key and picking voices in a new "Audio Settings" area.
- New Feature: Advanced In-Session Memory: Added a smart way for the AI to remember what's happening during your chat without slowing your computer down.
I lost a few braincells getting this working :/
- UI Overhaul: Made the whole app look new with a two-column design, putting all the settings on the side so the chat window is bigger.
- Model Recommendation Update: Now recommending llama3:8b-instruct-q4_K_M for the AI, because it's way faster and better at understanding what you want.
v1.2.5 - Depth Adherence & Stability Hotfix

v1.3 – The Personal Touch & Persona Lock Update

New Feature: Onboarding Setup – The app now starts with a simple guide: set your Handy key, choose an AI persona, and define your minimum and maximum depth. ElevenLabs setup comes next if desired.

Smarter AI Depth Mapping – The AI now knows your actual dick size (or close enough) thanks to the new calibration system. No more confusing tip with base.

Persona Consistency – The AI now always sticks to the persona you choose. If it's a bratty neko, it's staying a bratty neko.

Voice Update: ElevenLabs – Voice output should now be more stable and expressive, including moans and emotional tones when appropriate.

Improved Depth Semantics – Terms like “just the tip” or “go deeper” should now register correctly 85% of the time (yes, it was tested that thoroughly).

Emergency Stop Fix – Clicking “STOP EVERYTHING” now properly halts all motion. If it restarts, unplug your Handy. Seriously.

AutoMode Quirks – Talking to the AI during automode can still make things janky. Fix is coming later.

Experimental: Milking Mode – Still very WIP. If it goes haywire and turns you into a “goon spoon,” just remember: it’s learning.

Memory Saving Fix – Memory snapshots should now save properly rather than overwrite each other. Still being monitored for edge cases.

Overall Polish – Didn’t reinvent the wheel, but it definitely rolls smoother now.
