v1.2 - Fixed AI Depth Understanding: Made it so "tip," "mid," and "deep" strokes actually mean the right thing no matter your Max Depth setting.
Fixed AI Speed Perception: Told the AI exactly what "slow," "medium," and "fast" speeds are in numbers so it controls the Handy better.
Removed Unnecessary Speed Cap: Changed how the Handy moves so it can go faster even at shallow depths, for more fun teasing.
Introduced Max Depth Limiter:
    Added a "Max Depth" slider on the screen for you to set how far the Handy goes.
    Built in some code to remember your Max Depth setting even when you close the app.
    Most importantly, put a hard limit in the Handy control code to make sure it NEVER goes past your Max Depth, no matter what the AI tries to do.
Resolved UI Interactivity Issues: Fixed some messed-up code in index.html so all the buttons and sliders work right.
Fixed Preference Saving Errors: Fixed problems that stopped your settings from saving when you closed the app.
v1.2 - The Ergonomics & Audio Update

- New Feature: ElevenLabs Integration: Added full voice support using ElevenLabs, with settings for your API key and picking voices in a new "Audio Settings" area.
- New Feature: Advanced In-Session Memory: Added a smart way for the AI to remember what's happening during your chat without slowing your computer down.
I lost a few braincells getting this working :/
- UI Overhaul: Made the whole app look new with a two-column design, putting all the settings on the side so the chat window is bigger.
- Model Recommendation Update: Now recommending llama3:8b-instruct-q4_K_M for the AI, because it's way faster and better at understanding what you want.
v1.2.5 - Depth Adherence & Stability Hotfix

- Fixed AI Depth Adherence: Made the AI's instructions super clear with examples for "tip," "mid," and "deep" based on your Max Depth setting.
- It finally understands WHAT MAX DEPTH MEANS! :D
