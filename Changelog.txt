====================
    CHANGELOG
====================

=== v1.4.1 ===

- The AI can now focus on working the entire shaft.
- Noted the app/index files so hard their future generations will walk with a limp. 

=== v1.4 ===

- New Feature: Edging Mode has been added.
- New Feature: Added user-configurable timers in the UI to control the interval between moves in all special modes (Auto, Edging, Milking).
- AI now invents every move on the fly. Clicking the Like button saves the move to memory for future use. The more likes a move gets, the more often it will be used.
- The memory system has been overhauled to use a detailed user profile, which saves important info, personal details, and key memories from your sessions.
- The AI's persona can now be changed at any time from the sidebar during a chat.
- All special modes (Auto, Milking, Edging) now function as intended, inventing moves dynamically and respecting user settings.
- The Stop command is now more reliable.
- Chatting during special modes is now safe and will not interrupt the active mode.
- Added min/max speed settings to the onboarding guide.
- System prompt has been optimized, which may improve response speed on some hardware.


=== v1.3 – The update that borked the app :/ ===

- New Feature: Onboarding Setup – The app now starts with a simple guide to set your Handy key, choose a persona, and define your min/max depth.
- Smarter AI Depth Mapping: The calibration system ensures the AI understands your physical range, so it no longer confuses the tip with the base.
- Persona Consistency: The AI now strictly adheres to the persona you choose.
- Voice Update: ElevenLabs voice output is more stable and expressive.
- Improved Depth Semantics: Commands like just the tip or go deeper are now understood more reliably.
- Emergency Stop Fix: The STOP EVERYTHING button now correctly halts all motion.
- Memory Saving Fix: Memory snapshots now save correctly without overwriting each other.


=== v1.2.5 - Depth Adherence & Stability Hotfix ===


=== v1.2 - The Ergonomics & Audio Update ===

- New Feature: ElevenLabs Integration: Added full voice support, with settings for API key and voice selection.
- New Feature: Advanced In-Session Memory: Added a smarter way for the AI to remember what's happening during your chat.
- UI Overhaul: Redesigned the app with a two-column layout, moving settings to the sidebar for a larger chat window.
- Model Recommendation Update: The recommended AI model is now llama3:8b-instruct-q4_K_M for better speed and comprehension.
- Fixed AI Depth Understanding: Made it so tip, mid, and deep strokes are accurate regardless of your Max Depth setting.
- Fixed AI Speed Perception: Improved the AI's understanding of slow, medium, and fast speeds for better control.
- Introduced Max Depth Limiter: Added a Max Depth slider and a hard safety limit in the code to ensure the device never goes past your set depth.

- Fixed Preference Saving Errors: Corrected issues that prevented settings from saving properly when closing the app.
